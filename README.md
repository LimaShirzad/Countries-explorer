# Countries Explorer 🌍

This is my Week 3 assignment project.

In this project, I built a Countries Explorer app using React.  
The app allows users to search countries by name and filter them by region.

---

## What the app can do

- Load all countries from API
- Search countries by name
- Filter countries by region (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania)
- Show loading message while fetching data
- Show error message with retry button if something goes wrong
- Display country flag, name, region, and population
- Show "No results found" when nothing matches

---

## Technologies I used

- React (useState, useEffect)
- Vite
- REST Countries API
- CSS for styling

---

## API Endpoints Used

- All countries: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all  
- Search by name: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}  
- Filter by region: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/{region}
